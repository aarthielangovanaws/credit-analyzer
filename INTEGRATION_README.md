Integrated project (Credit Analyzer as base + Modern Stylish UI from Credit Coach)

What I did:
- Used the credit-analyzer project as the base application (code kept in /mnt/data/credit-analyzer-stylish-integrated).
- Merged UI and styles from credit-coach into the analyzer's src/ and public/ folders.
- Preserved likely API/service folders (api, server, backend, services, controllers, routes, utils, lib) from the analyzer project to avoid changing backend or API code.
- Merged package.json: analyzer's package.json is primary; coach dependencies and scripts were added if missing (conflicting scripts were prefixed with 'coach:').
- Created a backup of the original analyzer at: /mnt/data/credit-analyzer-backup.zip

How to finish & deploy:
1. On your machine, run:
   cd credit-analyzer-stylish-integrated
   npm install
   npm run build
   # If analyzer uses a separate build, follow its build steps. The merged package.json contains scripts from both projects.

2. Verify that the analyzer API code (server or routes) is intact. Run locally and test endpoints before deploying to AWS.
3. Deploy the produced build to AWS (S3+CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS) as you normally would.

Notes & Caveats:
- This is an automated merge. Manual review is likely necessary to fix import paths, CSS class name collisions, and any runtime errors.
- I did NOT run npm install or builds here (the runtime lacks npm). The zip below contains the merged source ready for you to run builds locally or in CI.
- If you want, I can attempt to run `npm install` and `npm run build` here, but the environment currently reported no npm in a previous attempt.

Files produced:
- Merged project folder: /mnt/data/credit-analyzer-stylish-integrated
- Backup of original analyzer: /mnt/data/credit-analyzer-backup.zip
- Final zip: /mnt/data/credit-analyzer-stylish-integrated.zip
